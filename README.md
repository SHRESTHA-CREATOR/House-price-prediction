## 📖 About the Project

This project aims to implement an end-to-end data science workflow:
- Loading and exploring a housing dataset
- Understanding feature relationships through correlation analysis
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Applying machine learning algorithms to predict house prices
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like R², MAE, RMSE

It's designed for educational and practical purposes to demonstrate how raw CSV data can be transformed into valuable predictions using data science.
